### Ballot Printing in Bulk (From External Printer)&#x20;

When using a third party printer, VotingWorks recommends printing ballots on paper between 28# Bond (105 GSM) - 65# Cover (177 GSM) for the best voter experience. The commonly available paper weights in this range are:&#x20;

* 28# Bond (105 GSM)
* 32# Bond (120 GSM)
* 100# Text (140 GSM)&#x20;
* 40# Bond (150 GSM)&#x20;

### Thermal paper for Tally Reports

VotingWorks delivers a starter pack of thick custom thermal paper with every VxScan. Currently, this paper can only be ordered directly from VotingWorks for $1.50 / sheet. Use this [order form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RtTbme5MPI\_CoafPLad6-7UuNb6uQi7hSNZGagNcCb0/edit) to order more.&#x20;

Off the shelf, thinner thermal paper may also be used (please note it lacks printed directions about which side to insert face up) like this: [https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/376633-REG/Brother\_LB3635\_Quality\_Paper\_8\_5x11.html](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/376633-REG/Brother\_LB3635\_Quality\_Paper\_8\_5x11.html)

### Marking Utensils

There is no specific recommendation for a marking utensil but it should be an ink pen that dries quickly. No markers.

### Seal & Port Blocker Requirements

The VxScan, ballot box, and VxAdmin and VxCentralScan cases should be secured with tamper evident numbered pull-tight seals like this: [https://www.cambridgeseals.com/heavy-duty-pull-tight-seal](https://www.cambridgeseals.com/heavy-duty-pull-tight-seal)\
or\

### Toner Cartridges

The HP printers for the VxAdmin (if purchased) use toner cartridge 58. HP offers two sizes:

* [HP 58A](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-58a-black-original-laserjet-toner-cartridge) - regular size, prints approximately 3000 pages
* [HP 58X](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-58x-high-yield-black-original-laserjet-toner-cartridge) - high yield, prints approximately 10000 pages

### USB Drive Recommendations and Compatibility

VotingWorks supports any USB 3.0+ drive that is 16GB or greater.

Larger capacity drives may be necessary when scanning large volumes (over 10,000) of ballots on VxCentralScan.
